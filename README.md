# BG7TBL_Reader
Read data from a BG7TBL Simple spectrum analyzer device

This program will read data from a BG7TBL and plot its fft and a scrolling spectrogram. In Linux Mint, you can open the fig.jpg file while it is running, so that the environment gets notified of the changes. Other linuxes probably have similar behavior. 

The default configuration is to plot the wifi band (2.4 GHz). You can change the start frequency and the other fields in the source file, but keep in mind the length of each field in ascii digits after the comment symbol.
